Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any current, updated and new products and services, including the addition of new properties shall be subject to these terms and conditions ("the Terms"). </p>
   
<p>The Terms govern your use of the Site (whether as a browser or registrant) and your uploading of, and use of, Content to the Site. You are only authorized to use the Site and Services (regardless of whether your access or use is intended) if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and to these Terms. You should read these Terms carefully. If you do not agree with them, you should leave the Site and discontinue use of the MYArtistDNA Services immediately. If you wish to become a Member, communicate with other Members and make use of the Services, you must read these Terms and indicate your acceptance of these terms and conditions. These Terms and Conditions can be changed at any time by MyArtistDNA.com.</p>
   
<p><span>GENERAL USE OF THE SITE</span></p> <br /> 
You may browse the Site without registering but in doing so you accept and agree that certain areas of the Site (for example, if you wish to upload Content to the Site) will not be available to you unless you register with the Site. You will be asked if you wish to register each time you try to access any part of the Site that requires registration. To register to the Site you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself; this is more particularly set out below.</p>
   
<p>You may post or upload your text, files, images, photos, video, sounds, musical works, works of authorship, or any other materials that relate solely to you (whether as a solo artistic performer or member of a performing group) to the Site ("Content"). Your posting, and our permitted use, of such Content will be governed by these Terms (and in particular the provisions of Clause 4 below).</p>
   
<p>We, in our sole discretion, will have the right to refuse to allow you to register to the Site. We will have the right to carry out those checks that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate to confirm your suitability for registration of the Site.</p>
   
<p>When you register with the Site you will create an account ("My Account"). This account is unique to you. The "My Account" section of the Site is where you can update, correct or delete your personal information as appropriate. Should you wish us to cease marketing to you, you should also go to "My Account" or contact support@myartistdna.com.</p>
   
<p>Any personal data you transmit to us by electronic mail or otherwise will be used by us in accordance with our Privacy Policy and you accept our Privacy Policy which is available for viewing here ________________________.</p>
   
<p>You hereby represent and warrant: 
<br />
