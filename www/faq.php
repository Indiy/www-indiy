<article id='anchor_how_much'>
<p>How much does MyArtistDNA cost?<br />
Nothing if you choose us as your partner. We call this the OPT IN option. By opting in we will guide you down this success path and equip you with the tools to succeed. You can OPT OUT. OPT OUT is an option that you pay a monthly fee to use the software and gives you the software with limited features to deploy. </p>

<article id='anchor_already_have_site'>
<p>I already have a site, how can I integrate it with MyArtistDNA?<br />
We think MyArtistDNA works best if you use it as your main site and the home of your brand, using other outlets like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter as supplementary marketing tools. Your account can be, replace or accompany your personal website.</p>
