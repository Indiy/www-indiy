                    <h3>Blakroc / Night of Legends</h3>
                    <p>MyArtistDNA will help you create a powerful foundation for your brand, will work with you to built it organically from the bottom up, and will give you the tools you need to keep honing your brand as it develops.
</p>
                    <p>The best branding starts simple and stays simple-and this was the approach we took when the Black Keys needed a website for their 11 track collaborative album, BlakRoc. We designed a clean and memorable logo for the album, and put together a straightforward set of brand guidelines for collaborating artists to pick up, allowing them to easily promote the album independently. We created a one-click link to the album on iTunes, and we hooked the website into the Black Keys existing site. The overall design was global enough to feel right for the wide variety of artists involved, but unique enough to create a strong and cohesive identity for the album.</p>

<p>Nights of Legend was another multi-artist project in need of cohesive branding that would resonate with a wide range of listeners. The one night televised event featured a cast of artists that rose to fame in the 50s and 60s, and it was important that the branding not only highlight these fifties roots, but also help introduce the artists to a new generation of listeners. We united these goals by channeling the vibe of retro diner into a sleek and modern design, with blocky fonts and crisp graphics. We also developed a content strategy, creating a separate page for each artist that featured videos, pictures, text, and album links.</p>

                    <p>A few photos and a clunky audio player don't cut it anymore. You need a website with SEO optimized language to help your fans find you, and seamless access to videos, music and merchandise to keep them involved. Your fans already like how you sound-now you need them to like what they see, with stunning, interactive design that can be viewed on any device.</p>
                    
<p>Navegante came to us with a edgy, electrorock sound, and we wanted to infuse this into the visual layout of their website. We developed colorful, smoky branding for them that we incorporated it into every element of the site, and fluidly integrated their Twitter and Facebook feeds. A unique, vertically scrolling page eliminated loading time and allowed users to move instantly between different components of the site. The site served as the hub of Navegante's web presence. </p>

<p>To promote his "One Night Stand" tour, Usher wanted a quick turnaround on a microsite that conveyed the sexy, glamorous feel of his shows, including videos, music, tour information, and a ticket giveaway. We love doing microsites-focused, high impact websites devoted to advertising an event, promoting a brand or launching a campaign. For Usher, we built a powerful media window to accommodate audio, video, and photos, giving the site a deep, immersive feel, and an embedded link to concert tickets completed the bridge between the site and the tour.</p>

                    <p>When Def Jam wanted to promote some of their major releases-like Jay-Z, Kanye West, and Jagged Edge-they came to us for focused, captivating sites and banner ads that would capture and encourage the excitement around these new albums. We did just that, building platforms centered on fan interaction complete with chatrooms, listening parties, wallpaper, and links to preoder the album. Short, eye-catching banner ads generated traffic and cultivated word of mouth buzz.</p>

                    <p>The boom of YouTube has made it clear-people love watching online video. A well made music video, webisode or live stream can introduce your music to thousands of new viewers and can solidify your fan base. MyArtistDNA is a one-stop music and viral video production house, and from idea to promotion our experts will help you get seen.</p>

<p>Navegante has fans both in their native Brooklyn and around the world, so it was important to get video online to encourage global listeners. We worked with them to create a series of videos-one, a short documentary style video to introduce the band and their sound; the second, a one take video for a new release; and the third a more polished music video that incorporated staged and live shots. Together, the videos conveyed both the excitement of their shows and the depth of their sound.</p>

<p>Young Chris came to us with an innovative hip hop sound, and we wanted to capitalize on that with videos that would situate within the breakout music scene. We produced two music videos, using inventive visual techniques cutting edge digital technology to create videos that perfectly captured the confidence and originality of his music.</p>
